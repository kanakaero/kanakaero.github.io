<h2>Digitalisation in Aeronautics and Space</h2>
<p align="justify">Digitalisation is changing our society and the working world, creating new processes and radically altering existing workﬂows. Aerospace is being impacted like every other scientiﬁc ﬁeld and innovation without digitalisation is no longer conceivable. The three-part MOOC series “Digitalisation in Aeronautics and Space” is thus devoted to examining the transformations that have already occurred and forthcoming likely changes, posing the question: what will aerospace science be like in future and what will the inﬂuence of digitalisation be on research? It is offered by the Technical University of Munich (TUM).</p>
