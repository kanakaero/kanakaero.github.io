<h2>About RSM</h2>
<p align="justify">The Research Society MIT (RSM) is an initiative meant to promote research among undergraduate students and get them involved from the grassroots level. It was started by six students in 2020 from various departments who recognized the need for a research-specific organization that wasnâ€™t restricted to any particular department, one that would facilitate interdisciplinary research and provide a forum through which could encourage technical discussions and interactions between students. It aims to connect and guide students, be a common platform for like-minded students, and provide resources to facilitate interdisciplinary and otherwise research.</p>
