<p align="justify">Currently participating in the seventh edition of the National Aerospace Conceptual Design Competition (NACDeC - VII). The problem statement for this edition is the conceptual design and sizing of a Martian Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with an all-up weight of 70 kg. The UAV would study the Martian planetary boundary layer corresponding to the lower stratum of the Martian atmosphere. A feasible UAV design will be presented after carefully considering different configurations and commercially available technologies. We have cleared the first and second rounds of the competition and are currently awaiting the results of the third round of the competition.</p>
