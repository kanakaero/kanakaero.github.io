<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify"> The problem statement entailed the optimisation of the NACA 4412 airfoil for operation at 30,000 ft in the subsonic regime constrained to a set of specific airfoil shape constraints as outlined in the competition guidelines. A multi-faceted approach was taken to solving the given problem. A mesh validation study was conducted to verify the quality of the mesh. A parametric sweep was carried out in Ansys Fluent to evaluate the scope of the problem. Based on this, an optimisation using CST coefficients was conducted by integrating MATLAB with XFOIL. This was achieved using a genetic algorithm. The optimised aerofoil thus achieved was subjected to a parametric sweep to validate and compile the resulting aerofoil's characteristics. </p>
