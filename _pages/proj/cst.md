<h2>Problem Statement </h2>
<p align="justify">The Class Shape Transformation (CST) parametrisation technique was developed by Brenda Kulfan, an aerodynamic engineer at Boeing, in 2008. It incorporates a geometric class/shape function transformation technique. The Class Shape Transformation technique (CST) was carried out on 15 aerofoils using MATLAB. Further, the weighted coefficients, i.e., the coefficients of the eighth-order Bernstein polynomial, were calculated for each aerofoil. There is a minimal margin of error between the original and the obtained aerofoils. Extremely accurate results have been obtained from the mathematical model.</p>
