<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">A performance analysis was conducted on the Airbus A380- 800M and the results were plotted using MATLAB. Once the results were plotted, they were analysed, and suitable conclusions were drawn from the respective polars. While conducting the performance analysis of the aircraft, six aspects of the aircraft's performance were focused on. Namely, the drag polar, the flight envelope (V-h Plot), the aircraft's climb, turn, take-off and landing performance. All these analyses culminated into the Payload v/s Range trade-off study.</p>
